    "For our dataset, we settled on automotive data from MarketCheck spanning 8 years of inventory in Canada. Each record indicates the most recent online activity for a particular vehicle, obtained via webcrawlers that aggregate info retrieved from a vast number (~65k) of dealer websites. Online activity is not defined, but it is reasonably safe (based on the 'price' attribute provided) to assume that the records indicate sale listings (and not leases, or rentals).\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the dataset's [Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/3ea0a6a45dbd4713a8759988845f1a58038036d84515ded58f65a2ff2bd32e00?resource=download), it was last updated a year ago, so we can reasonably expect 2021 to be the upper limit for the year of car manufacture.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset comprises some expected attributes such as the price, make, mileage and manufacturing year of the car. It also includes more specific (and potentially more interesting) attributes such as the fuel type, the engine size, the (corporate) dealer name and site of activity (zip and province).\n",
    "\n",
    "While our exact goal is not settled upon just yet, as we have not studied the data in-depth enough to hone in on a single phenom, listed below are a few possible phenomenon that are in contention to be studied by us in future iterations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* correlation of price to the make and year of a vehicle\n",
    "* correlation of vehicle fuel type to sales (or frequency of sales, more specifically)\n",
